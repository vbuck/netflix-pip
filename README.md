netflix-pip
===========

Based on the work by Emmett McPoland, this Chrome extension docks Netflix videos to the corner of the screen allowing seamless browsing between tabs and applications.

When you sign into Netflix, select the video you want to watch or resume. 

After clicking, you will receive a confirmation box that asks if you want to open the video in picture-in-picture mode. Click 'OK.'

Close the open tab, and you will see a small window in the lower-right corner of the screen appear. Your video will play there.

FAQ

### Why does Netflix tell me that I have two players open?
You will have to close the open tab after opening the video in PIP mode. In a future revision I will be adding support for auto-closing the open tab.
